==============

Ansible dynamic inventory reading the inventory from YAML file.


Description
-----------

Standard Ansible inventory file has a flat structure where all groups are
on the same level and relate to each other via `:children` definition.
This leads to long group names when trying to capture more complex
relationships. Inventory groups also correspond to `group_vars` files
which are also affected by the complexity of the group names.

This Ansible dynamic inventory script is trying to address these issues
by reading the inventory from YAML file. The YAML hierarchical format
significantly simplifies the way how the groups are named and how
relationships between the groups are created.

For comparison, here is the standard Ansible inventory file:

```
[aws:children]
aws-dev
aws-qa
aws-stg
aws-prd

[aws-dev]
aws-dev-host01        ansible_host=192.168.1.15

[aws-dev:children]
aws-dev-jenkins

[aws-dev-jenkins]
aws-dev-jenkins01     ansible_host=192.168.1.16

[aws-qa]
aws-qa-host01         ansible_host=192.168.2.15

[aws-stg]
aws-stg-host01        ansible_host=192.168.3.15

[aws-prd]
aws-prd-host01        ansible_host=192.168.4.15


[azure:children]
azure-dev
azure-qa
azure-stg
azure-prd

[azure-dev]
azure-dev-host01      ansible_host=10.0.1.15

[azure-dev:children]
azure-dev-jenkins

[azure-dev-jenkins]
azure-dev-jenkins01   ansible_host=10.0.1.16

[azure-qa]
azure-qa-host01       ansible_host=10.0.2.15

[azure-stg]
azure-stg-host01      ansible_host=10.0.3.15

[azure-prd]
azure-prd-host01      ansible_host=10.0.4.15
```

And here is the same but in the YAML format:

```
---

aws:
  dev:
    :hosts:
      - aws-dev-host01:        { ansible_host: 192.168.1.15 }
    jenkins:
      :hosts:
        - aws-dev-jenkins01:   { ansible_host: 192.168.1.16 }
  qa:
    :hosts:
      - aws-qa-host01:         { ansible_host: 192.168.2.15 }
  stg:
    :hosts:
      - aws-stg-host01:        { ansible_host: 192.168.3.15 }
  prd:
    :hosts:
      - aws-prd-host01:        { ansible_host: 192.168.4.15 }

azure:
  dev:
    :hosts:
      - azure-dev-host01:      { ansible_host: 10.0.1.15 }
    jenkins:
      :hosts:
        - azure-dev-jenkins01: { ansible_host: 10.0.1.16 }
  qa:
    :hosts:
      - azure-qa-host01:       { ansible_host: 10.0.2.15 }
  stg:
    :hosts:
      - azure-stg-host01:      { ansible_host: 10.0.3.15 }
  prd:
    :hosts:
      - azure-prd-host01:      { ansible_host: 10.0.4.15 }
```

The script adds several more features which simplify the work with the
inventory:

- Automatic `.vault` files loading.
- Adding hosts to/from other groups.
- Using vars files as a common template.

See more details in the examples bellow.


Usage
-----

### Inventory YAML file

The main YAML inventory should be stored in the `main.yaml` file located
by default in the `inventory` directory. The location can be changed in
the config file (`inventory_path` - see the `yaml_inventory.conf` file)
or via environment variable (`YAML_INVENTORY_PATH`).

This is an example of a monolithic inventory YAML file:

```
---

aws:
  dev:
    elk:
      elasticsearch:
        # Hosts of the aws-dev-elk-elasticsearch group
        :hosts:
          # Hosts with variables
          - elk01: { ansible_host: 192.168.1.11 }
          - elk02: { ansible_host: 192.168.1.12 }
          - elk03: { ansible_host: 192.168.1.13 }
      kibana:
        # Hosts of the aws-dev-elk-kibana group
        :hosts:
          # Host with no variables
          - elk04
```

The same like above but with YAML reference:

```
---

# This is a subset of the main data structure referenced bellow
aws-dev: &aws-dev
  elk:
    elasticsearch:
      :hosts:
        - elk01: { ansible_host: 192.168.1.11 }
        - elk02: { ansible_host: 192.168.1.12 }
        - elk03: { ansible_host: 192.168.1.13 }
    kibana:
      :hosts:
        - elk04

# This is the main data structure
aws:
  dev:
    # Reference to the above data structure
    <<: *aws-dev
```

This is the same like above but with the referenced content in a separate
file:

Content of the `aws-dev.yaml` file:

```
---

# This can be still referenced from the main YAML file
aws-dev: &aws-dev
  elk:
    elasticsearch:
      :hosts:
        - elk01: { ansible_host: 192.168.1.11 }
        - elk02: { ansible_host: 192.168.1.12 }
        - elk03: { ansible_host: 192.168.1.13 }
    kibana:
      :hosts:
        - elk04
```

Content of the `main.yaml` file:

```
---

# This is the main data structure
aws:
  dev:
    # Refference the above data structure
    <<: *aws-dev
```

The inventory script reads all YAML files from the `inventory` directory
and merges them all together. The `main.yaml` portion is always inserted
at the end so that the YAML references can still be resolved. Group names
are composed from elements of the tree separated by `-` sign.

As visible above, the YAML structure contains special keyword `:hosts`.
That keyword indicates that content of that section is a list of hosts.
Other keywords are `:vars`, `:template`, `:groups` and `:add_hosts`.
The following is an example of usage of all the keywords:

```
---

g1:
  :hosts:
    - ahost1
    - ahost2
  :vars:
    # Variable for the group g1
    my_var: 123
g2:
  :hosts:
    - bhost1
    - bhost2
  :groups:
    # Add all hosts from group g2 into the group g1
    - g1
g3:
  :hosts:
    - chost1
    - chost2
  :templates:
    # This creates g3@template-g3 group which has the g3 group as its
    # child. That will allow to load the inventory vars from the file in
    # inventory/vars/template/g3. As the g3 group is a child of the
    # template group, variables from the g3 inventory vars file can
    # still override the vars in the template file.
    - template-g3
g4:
  :add_hosts:
    # Regular expression to import hosts ahost2 and bhost2 to this group
    - ^[ab]host2
```


### Inventory vars

Classical `group_vars` files can be structured in two levels only - files
in the `group_vars` directory and file in the directories located in the
`group_vars` directory. This is quite restrictive and forces the user to
capture the inventory groups structure in the `group_vars` file name.

This Ansible dynamic inventory is trying to address this issue by
introducing the inventory vars. Inventory vars are variation of the
`group_vars` with the difference that it copies the hierarchical
structure of YAML inventory file. The inventory vars directory is by
default in the `inventory/vars` directory but can be changed in the
config file (`inventory_vars_path`) or via environment variable
(`YAML_INVENTORY_VARS_PATH`). This feature is enabled by default but can
be disabled by setting the `create_symlinks` config option or the
`YAML_INVENTORY_CREATE_SYMLINKS` environment variable to value `no`.

The inventory vars file for a specific group can be called either like
the last element of the group name or like `all` inside a directory
called like the last element of the group name. If the group contains
another groups, only the second option is available because there cannot
coexist file and directory of the same name.

If this is the inventory file:

```
---

# This is a group containing another group (vars in `all` file)
aws:
  dev:
    # This is the leaf group (vars in `jenkins` file)
    jenkins:
      :hosts:
        - aws-dev-jenkins01
```

then the corresponding file structure of the inventory vars can look like
this:

```
$ tree -p inventory
inventory
└── [drwxr-xr-x]  aws
    ├── [-rw-r--r--]  all
    └── [drwxr-xr-x]  dev
        └── [-rw-r--r--]  jenkins
```

If enabled, the inventory vars are symlinked into the `group_vars`
directory during the execution of the inventory script. The `group_vars`
file names are based on the structure of the invetory vars directory.
From the example above, the path `invenotory/aws/all` is symlinked like
`group_vars/aws` and the path `invenotory/aws/dev/jenkins` is symlinked
like `group_vars/aws-dev-jenkins`.

```
$ ls -la ./group_vars
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 jtyr users 4096 Mar 28 17:20 .
drwxr-xr-x 9 jtyr users 4096 Mar 27 10:10 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jtyr users   21 Mar 28 17:20 aws -> ../inventory/vars/aws/all
lrwxrwxrwx 1 jtyr users   29 Mar 28 17:20 aws-dev-jenkins -> ../inventory/vars/aws/dev/jenkins
```

The script also simplifies the use of Vault files by automatically
creating relationship between the group (e.g. `mygroup`) and the secured
content of that group (`mygroup.vault`). This convention makes sure that
the Vault file is always loaded if it exists.


### Inventory script

The inventory script can be used as any other Ansible dynamic inventory.
With the default settings (the `main.yaml` inventory file in the
`./inventory` directory and the inventory files in the `./inventory/vars`
directory) the command can be as follows:

```
$ ansible-playbook -i ./yaml_inventory.py site.yaml
```

The inventory script implements the standard `--list` and `--host`
command line options and can be influenced by a config file (see
`yaml_inventory.conf` file) or environment variables:

```
usage: yaml_inventory.py [-h] [--list] [--host HOST]

Ansible dynamic inventory reading YAML file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --list       list all groups and hosts
  --host HOST  get vars for a specific host

environment variables:
  YAML_INVENTORY_CONFIG_PATH
    location of the config file (default locations:
      ./yaml_inventory.conf
      ~/.ansible/yaml_inventory.conf
      /etc/ansible/yaml_inventory.conf)
  YAML_INVENTORY_PATH
    location of the inventory directory (./inventory by default)
  YAML_INVENTORY_VARS_PATH
    location of the inventory vars directory (YAML_INVENTORY_PATH/vars by default)
  YAML_INVENTORY_GROUP_VARS_PATH
    location of the vars directory (./group_vars by default)
  YAML_INVENTORY_CREATE_SYMLINKS
    flag to create group_vars symlinks (enabled by default)
```
