# If set to "yes", symbolic links for files from the inventory/vars will be
# created in the group_vars directory. This is required when using fully
# encrypted .vault files. If set to "no", the variables from the
# files in the inventory/vars will be added directly into the dynamic
# inventory output. This should only be used if there are no .vault files.
